## Welcome to Sprig!
At Hack Club we believe strongly that the best way to learn to code is by making creative, interesting, meaningful projects. Sprig is a project by Hack Club that enables anyone to do just that - we've created a web editor that both beginners and more advanced programmers can have fun making games in, and an accompanying handheld console that you can get for free by publishing your own game!

By the end of today's session, we'll be making our first project in Sprig: a Sokoban-style push block game!

## 1. What's Sprig?

![](https://sprig.hackclub.com/stories-tiny/sprig-front.jpeg)

Sprig is a game editor and engine built to enable beginners (and more advanced programmers!) to get started building fun, interesting games quickly while learning technologies and skills that you can use to make a ton of other cool stuff. 

It's also a DIY handheld game console kit that you can receive by making your own game, which can play any game you build with Sprig!

### What level of programming is required to make Sprig games?

You will be learning and using JavaScript, and no previous experience with it is required. These are some examples of two games made by beginners:
1. [Lava and Water](https://sprig.hackclub.com/gallery/Lava_and_Water) by Akeel
2. [QuadraPedal](https://sprig.hackclub.com/gallery/QuadraPedal) by Jamarkis

For those of you with more JS experience, designing and building games can stretch and challenge your skills. Check out these games that really push what Sprig can do:
1. [Raycasting](https://sprig.hackclub.com/gallery/raycasting) by Henry
2. [Chess](https://sprig.hackclub.com/gallery/chess) by Thomas

### Why should I bother with Sprig?
Sprig is an awesome tool to get started in programming! Sprig uses the [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) programming language, which is one of the most popular in the world. By coding games in Sprig, you'll get familiar with the language used to code many of the world's websites, apps, and games. Additionally, many of the concepts you'll learn are applicable to all of programming.

By completing your own game in Sprig, you'll also qualify to receive a [Sprig Console](https://github.com/hackclub/sprig-hardware); it's a DIY kit to make a handheld console, and it can run any Sprig game you build on a computer! 

Finally - it's simply really awesome (at least in my opinion) to build games & projects, struggle through figuring out how to make things work, and then feel a sense of accomplishment after making something really cool that challenged you! Even if you're a beginner, it's possible to get started making some really fun games with Sprig.

## 2. Let’s explore the Sprig editor!

This video guides you are around the world of Sprig

Start your adventure here https://sprig.hackclub.com/  
From there, check out the gallery of games submitted by teenagers from all over the world. https://sprig.hackclub.com/gallery

Note that you can choose any game in the gallery to see its code. In fact, this is a great way to learn coding– see how other hackers solved their game design problems!

You’re now in the Sprig code editor! Hitting the RUN button runs the current code, and allows you to play the game.  
Fun hint: the size of your editor and play window can be adjusted.

Tutorials are a bit different; to the bottom right, there is an additional “Tutorial” tab. It contains instructions. The toolkit has been moved to another tab.

Remember to click the "remix" button in the top right corner, so that your changes are saved.

## 4. Wrap-up!
Congratulations! By finishing this session, you just made your first game in Sprig!

Next session, we'll be starting the maze game that we'll be creating from scratch and working on for the next (TODO: 2 or 3) sessions.
